# Why?

Firstly, they've been saying that for a long time now...

Secondly, why the hell do people want a "Dislike" button on Facebook?

If you don't *like* something on Facebook, don't press the like button!

The *Like* button is there for spreading positivity. If you agree something or like something, you press it and show that. It saves writing "me too!" or "+1"...

But a *Dislike* button is just about negativity. Why is negativity something people want to share?

This is one of the problems with YouTube. They have a *Dislike* button and people get upset by it's numbers or attack other YouTubers by getting their videos purposely disliked...

Positivity is better than Negativity and is something that should be shared and encouraged. Nowadays more than ever, it seems...
