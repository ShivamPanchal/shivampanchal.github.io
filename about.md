Hi, I'm Dan Bennett!

Currently I am classed as a VLE Technical Consultant & Director of [PriorsVLE](https://www.priorsvle.com), providing technical support services for Moodle, Totara and Mahara administrators!

Outside of work, I am a Music Producer. Focusing mostly on UK Hardcore, but also creating strange sounds within the Dance and Progressive range...
You can find some sounds I've done on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/danbennettuk).

I'm also a past Radio Presenter. It's something I really enjoyed and really want to get into again. So - if you work at a radio station... Hi? ;-)

### Contact me

This is rather brief and I need to sit down and fully update this. But in the mean time, come say `Hello` on [Twitter] or by [E-Mail].
