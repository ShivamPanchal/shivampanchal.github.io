## Bio

Hi there, **I'm Shivam**!

I am a **Bachelor of Technology** from *Harcourt Butler Technological Institute*, Kanpur.

I have been working as a Data Science Consultant from past three years in the field of Data Analysis & Data-Driven Decision Making, Statistical Analysis Techniques, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Modelling, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

I have worked across various domains such as *Banking and Finance, Healthcare and Telecom*. Information and Knowledge is power in business, and data is the fuel that creates this power. I help my clients to harness the power of data into thier organizations and  
building solutions to help them grow using to extract knowledge from data and leveraging this data to take major decisions is a key strategic practice for any business problem. I have a profound interest in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things. I love to code and travel. I love all breeds of dogs.
